# Most-Cost-Efficient-and-Accurate-Way-to-Predict-Rain-in-Australia
This project was for Cloud Computing at the University of Houston during Fall 2021. It was about finding the most cost efficient and accurate way to predict rainfall in Australia. The project experiments with and compares the performance of the Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud when building Classification models with machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree. By calculating the time it takes to build a different classification model, choosing the service that can build the model faster would suggest which cloud service will be cheaper to use while providing the same results. In addition to testing different machine learning algorithms, the scalability of the models and the performance of different instances the cloud services provide will be tested. The dataset will be split into 1000, 10000, and 100000 rows to test how well the cloud services handle scalability while building the classification models. The instances tested for AWS are t2.medium, t2.large, and t2.xlarge while the instances tested for Google Cloud are e2.medium, e2-standard-2, and e2-standard-4
